--------What Is React?---------

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

----------COMPONENTS------------
Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. 
Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props)
and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.
